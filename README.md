# github-contributions-graphs
Now, you will be able to download a contribution graph for each year or a chart that includes all of the graphs per year... with (dark mode only) themes!!

Due to potential threats of server overload (aka graphql api rate limit reach) by bots, please deploy this **_yourself_** on **Vercel** or **Render**
